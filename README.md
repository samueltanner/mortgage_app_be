1. Clone repo

`git clone https://github.com/samueltanner/mortgage_app_be.git`

2. Get a virtual environment running using the virtualenv package. This will create a .env file at the root of the app

`virtualenv mortgage_env`

3. Activate the virtual environment

`source mortgage_env/bin/activate`

4. Depending on your python version installed globally on your machine (or locally in your virtual env) you will either run:

`pip3 install requirements.text`

or

`pip install requirements.text`

The only difference being pip vs. pip3.
